make sure mailtrack.png in root dir isn't accessible by mfs.

instead of parameters (which may look sus) just whatever 346654432.png they ask for return same one
36 (abcs+0-9) is ~2billion options. every image will be a new six letter/number combo, plus a user id (which can go up infinitely) .png

so, for url requests, ie fj490f1.png you would have fj490f as id and 1 as user.

make sure im not vuln to database crashing if someone submits a url with 1 billion letters/numbers or something

* database columns:
  * time
  * user
  * id
  * IP
